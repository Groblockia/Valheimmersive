The Blood Howl Cult

Long after Ulver the Faceless was cast into exile with his creations, a fractured sect of Fenrings—called the Blood Howl Cult—broke away from the others. Obsessed with restoring their god’s face and driven mad by centuries of rage, they began harvesting blood from the primal Ulvs, believing it carried echoes of Fenrir's original power.

They drink it. Bathe in it. Rage with it.

The blood warps them—both mind and muscle. They scream in tongues only Ulver can decipher. Their rituals involve violent “Red Sermons” where they inject or drink Ulv ichor and enter manic trances, punching trees, tearing at stone, howling into the night.

They're a danger to both ally and enemy—barely sentient when consumed by the frenzy—but they’re fiercely loyal, chanting:
“Restore the face, burn the sky, let the gods bleed dry.”
