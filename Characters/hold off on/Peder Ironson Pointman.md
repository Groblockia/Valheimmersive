### Rune: Kaunaz

### Lore: 
Peder Ironsong was born on a night when the aurora split the sky into rivers of green fire. His mother, a shieldmaiden, claimed his father was none other than Bragi, the skald-god of poetry and craft. The old women of the village laughed at the idea — until the baby came into the world gripping a glowing stone and the Kenaz rune, symbol of fire, knowledge, and creation, flared red-hot on his chest.

They named him Ironsong because when he cried, the forge fires roared louder and hammers struck anvils without a hand to guide them.

From the start, Peder lived between two worlds — warrior and builder, breaker and maker. He could split a man's skull with an axe and, with the same hands, raise a longhouse so perfect it sang in the wind. His mind burned with invention. He carved ships with dragon-prows that cut through the fiercest storms. He shaped swords that seemed to hum with hunger in battle.

But a demigod’s life is never simple. Peder’s power made him a prize for kings and jarls who sought to chain him to their causes. He refused all collars. Instead, he founded his own hall — Skaldheim — a place where warriors, builders, and poets gathered under one roof. They would not just conquer; they would create. Not just take; but leave behind something worthy of song.

Enemies came, of course. Raiders jealous of his strength. Warlords fearful of his ideas. Peder met them all with axe and hammer, leaving broken shields and shattered bones in his wake. His legend grew: Peder Ironsong, the Builder of Fortresses, the Breaker of Armies.

He wore no crown. He sat on no throne. His only mark of rule was the Kenaz rune, which glowed ever brighter across his skin as his legend spread — a fire that would never die, a forge that would never cool.

In the end, they said he would not die like other men. When his time came, he would build his own ship from the bones of mountains and sail the stars to halls even the gods had yet to raise.
