### Rune: *missing*

### Lore: 
In the frost-kissed fjords of 9th-century Scandinavia, where the mountains whispered tales of gods and giants, Bruni Thorvaldsson stood as a legend among the Norse. Known as Bruni the Unyielding, he was no ordinary craftsman; he was a master artisan whose works were said to be blessed by the hands of Thor himself. His name echoed through mead halls, from the rugged shores of Vestfold to the wind-swept isles of the Danes, for his creations were not merely structures but monuments to the glory of his people.

Origins
Bruni was born in a humble village nestled in the shadow of a great glacier, the son of a shipwright and a weaver. From childhood, he showed an uncanny knack for shaping wood and stone, crafting toys that seemed to hum with life. His father taught him the secrets of oak and pine, how to read the grain as one reads a saga, while his mother wove tales of Odin’s wisdom and Loki’s cunning into his dreams. At age twelve, Bruni carved a miniature longship so perfect that it sailed a stream without tipping, earning the attention of the local jarl.

Rise to Mastery
Apprenticed to a grizzled builder named Hrothgar, Bruni learned to wield axe and adze with surgical precision. Hrothgar, a man who had raised halls for kings, saw in Bruni a spark of divine inspiration. “You build not for men, lad,” he once growled, “but for the ages.” By his twentieth winter, Bruni had surpassed his mentor, designing a great hall for Jarl Sigtrygg that withstood a blizzard so fierce it was said to be Fenrir’s breath. The hall’s beams, carved with runes of protection, never creaked, and its hearth burned bright through the longest nights.
Bruni’s genius lay in his ability to marry form and function. His longhouses were warm in winter yet cool in summer, their timbers fitted so tightly that not a single draft could sneak through. His bridges spanned raging rivers, defying floods that swept away lesser works. Yet his true gift was his vision: every structure told a story. A watchtower he built on a cliff bore carvings of Jörmungandr, the world serpent, coiled around its base, warding off raiders with its fearsome glare. A temple to Freya shimmered with inlaid amber, glowing like the goddess’s tears at dawn.

The Saga of the Skyhold
Bruni’s greatest work was the Skyhold, a fortress commissioned by King Harald Finehair to unite the warring clans of Norway. The king demanded a stronghold that could withstand both mortal armies and the wrath of the gods. Bruni, now in his prime, accepted the challenge, though whispers spoke of a prophecy: the builder of such a place would pay a price to the Norns, the weavers of fate.
For three years, Bruni toiled on a windswept plateau. He quarried stone from a sacred mountain, said to be the resting place of a jotunn’s heart, and felled trees from a forest guarded by spirits. His designs were revolutionary: a central keep with walls that sloped to deflect battering rams, surrounded by a ring of watchtowers linked by hidden tunnels. The fortress’s great hall could house a thousand warriors, its roof supported by beams carved to resemble Yggdrasil, the world tree. Runes of strength and unity glowed faintly in the firelight, etched by Bruni’s own hand.
When the Skyhold was complete, it was said to be impregnable, a place where the Valkyries themselves might rest. Harald Finehair declared it a wonder of the Norse world, and skalds composed sagas of Bruni’s feat. Yet the prophecy came true. On the night of the fortress’s consecration, as Bruni raised a horn to Thor, a bolt of lightning struck him down. Some say it was the gods claiming their due; others believe Bruni had woven his own life into the Skyhold’s stones, giving it a soul.

Bruni awakened to find himself on the shores of a strange land visited by a raven. "The gods have noticed you" it squawked "such talents are not to be wasted on mortal men"
