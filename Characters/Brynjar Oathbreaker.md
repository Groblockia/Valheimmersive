Brynjar Oathbreaker walks where thunder once slept.
Once chosen to guard what should never be touched, he faltered — not in strength, but in desire.
The sky split, the storm wept, and the oath shattered.
Cast into Ginnungagap, he wanders the forsaken edges of memory, burdened by silence, marked by something he should not bear.
In his grip, echoes of the old storm linger — and the gods do not speak his name.
