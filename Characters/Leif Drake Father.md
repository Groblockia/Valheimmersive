Leif, the Skyborn — Father of Drakes

Not all who were cast into Ginnungagap were broken. Some, like Leif, were simply too dangerous.

One of the first to be imprisoned, Leif was a demigod born of wind and winter, silent and soaring. While the rest of us shaped the Abyss into a twisted utopia—gilded with stolen mortal souls, fed by the fire of rebellion—Leif wandered the fringes, speaking in tongues the void barely remembered.

He did not seek thrones, nor titles. He sought freedom.

The drakes—those wild, cold-blooded beasts—bowed to no one. Except him. They called him father, though none could say whether he created them or simply earned their eternal loyalty.

Then, one day, Leif was gone.

No gate was opened. No ritual cast. No god intervened. He simply vanished—escaped the inescapable Ginnungagap. A feat thought impossible.

Some say he was devoured by the void for his defiance. Others claim he walks the mortal realms, free of god or chain, his soul untouchable. And a few… whisper that he is building something greater. Something the gods will never see coming.

All we know is this:

Leif was the first to slip the leash.

He will not be the last.
