### Rune: *missing*

### Lore: 
Torin of the Green Flame
Born of a forgotten goddess and cast out by the gods, Torin of the Green Flame bears the rune Inguz, symbol of transformation and growth. Banished to Valheim to silence his quiet power, he now walks its wilds as a force of rebirth—rooting in ruin, blooming in shadow, and shaping fate not with conquest, but with the unstoppable will to become.

Torin of the Green Flame 
Bearer of the Rune Inguz, Bastard Son of the Wild Goddess 
Few speak aloud the tale of Torin, for it begins not in glory, but in secrecy. He was born beneath 
a blood moon in the shadowed glades beyond the knowing of men, where the roots of Yggdrasil 
drink deep and ancient whispers still stir the leaves. His mother, a forgotten goddess of 
overgrowth and wild waters, had once walked freely among mortals, her heart too soft for 
Asgard’s cold order. From a brief, forbidden union came a child—a spark unmeant, a seed 
unsanctioned. 

Marked from birth by the rune Inguz, the symbol of becoming, Torin was no chosen heir, no 
shining prince. The rune did not promise greatness—it promised potential. The kind that blooms 
unseen in dark soil, that defies the world’s will with patient growth. As he grew, the signs 
deepened: where Torin passed, ruined earth grew verdant, rivers ran clearer, and forgotten 
places stirred to life. A green flame, quiet and eternal, took root within his chest—a 
manifestation of life’s will to renew, even in desolation. 

But such quiet power does not go unnoticed. The gods saw in Torin a breaking of their laws and 
a harbinger of change. Odin, whose eye sees too much and trusts too little, judged the boy 
dangerous—not for what he was, but for what he might become. Yet to kill him would mean war 
with his mother, and to welcome him would invite unrest among the halls of the divine. 
So the Allfather chose exile. In secret, Torin was cast into Ginnunagap, realm of forgotten warriors 
and lost souls. It was meant as a prison, a place of silence and ash where divine mistakes are 
buried. 

But Torin is not so easily buried. 

In Ginnunagap, he did not wither—he rooted. The flame within him burned brighter beneath the stars 
of exile. Where others saw ruin, he saw fertile ground. He does not conquer with fire or blade, 
but with change—the slow, unstoppable kind. He is no mere warrior, but a gardener of fate, a 
seed of the old world cast into the soil of the next. 
He is Torin of the Green Flame, bearer of Inguz, the bastard child of a forgotten goddess, and 
the quiet force that heralds rebirth in the lands of the dead.
